{% hint style="info" %}
A **cashmere goat** is a type of [goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat) that produces [cashmere wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere\_wool), the goat's fine, soft, downy, winter undercoat, in commercial quality and quantity.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere\_goat#cite\_note-AGN-1) This undercoat grows as the day length shortens and is associated with an outer coat of coarse hair, which is present all year and is called guard hair. Most common goat breeds, including dairy goats, grow this two-coated fleece.
